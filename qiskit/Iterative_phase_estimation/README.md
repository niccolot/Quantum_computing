Iterative phase estimation (IPE) is an alternative to the traditional quantum phase estimation algorithm (QPE), 
the latter prone to errors due to qbits interference and decorrelation in near term real devices, becoming quite unusable on certain situations.

IPE promises to overcome this difficulties estimating the phase in a iterative way, differently from the parallelism of the QPE, very useful with a large number of qbits
but prone to error with real devices.
