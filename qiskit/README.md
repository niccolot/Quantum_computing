Basic quantum algorithms written with the IBMs qiskit python library 
https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/lab/docs/iql/ on the line of the material of 'qiskit lab' 

***Iterative_phase_estimation*** contains a project in which are addressed the problems of noisy results for quantum pahse estimation
algorithm and is presented the alternative algorithm iterative phase estimation, more rubust to noise and so particularly suitable
for NISQ (noisy and few qbits) devices
